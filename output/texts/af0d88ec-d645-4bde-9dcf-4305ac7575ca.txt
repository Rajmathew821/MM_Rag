In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneﬁcial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-ﬁtting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [8], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.
