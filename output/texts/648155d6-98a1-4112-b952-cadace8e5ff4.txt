We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.
