Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of ﬂoating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision ﬂoating-point capacity of each GPU 5.
